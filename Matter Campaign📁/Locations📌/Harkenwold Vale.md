### description
1.  a pocket of rolling hills and grasslands between two spurs of the great Harken Forest. It is nestled in the White River valley, a sleepy community of small villages and independent homesteads that nominally is under the banner of a Baron. This family has ruled since ancient times, claiming descendancy from an ancient empire that once ruled a vast swath of the worldâ€¦ whether its true or not is unknown, but the Barony of Harkenwold has held sway for at least the last century. Out of the way and without great wealth, much of the outside world ignores the Harkenwold Vale and many of the residents are happy to have it as such.

    Sages and travelers say that Harkenwold is simply one piece of a great land, known in ancient times as the Nentir. An ancient name, it stretches from the Dawnforge Mountains in the east, to the Stonemarch Mountains far to the northwest, while the great Winterbole Forest is many hundreds of miles north from the Harken Forest. Some claim that all the land was once a vast forest before it was cut in two, but that would have been millenia ago and so most pay it no mind.
