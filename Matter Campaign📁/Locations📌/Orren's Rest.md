### Description
1.  a small community centered around a coaching inn and a general store, both run by the Salar family. Sibbi Salar is the patriarch and nominal ealdorman when needed, and his half-dozen children help run the business and the inn. There is also a mason's workshop, where stone is carved and used to maintain the three bridges that afford travel along the important road from Albridge to Marl. A pair of masons, a human named Grant the Elder and a dwarf from the east, Bolden Stonebeard, work the shop and also send surplus stone to the town of Marl in the south. The central "village" has about a dozen buildings and maybe fifty residents, with an equal number living nearby on farmsteads and outlying cabins. Perhaps two of the most notable of these distant relatives are the ranger Willam Wild, a taciturn woodsman who many say once fought in wars to the northwest, and the herbalist Lewellyn, a beautiful but quiet elven druid who once roamed with the Woodsinger clans. The only other citizen of note is Oben Jakes, the owner of a small watermill near the bridge and the only tiefling in the settlement. Some say he is a foul warlock who charges too much to use his mill, but he is always quiet and takes delight in entertaining children with small illusion magics.
